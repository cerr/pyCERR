The Image Biomarker Standardisation Initiative (IBSI)<sup>1</sup> standardized the use of eight types of convolutional filters for use in radiomics and quantitative image analysis, viz., mean filters, Laplacian-of-Gaussian filters, Laws kernels, Gabor kernels, separable wavelets, decomposed separable wavelets, non-separable wavelets and decomposed non-separable wavelets.
This directory contains NIfTI-format reference response maps for standardized convolutional filters, generated and provided by the [IBSI](https://github.com/theibsi/ibsi_2_reference_data/tree/main/reference_response_maps) and are used to verify that pyCERR's implementation is compliant with the IBSI standard.
The IBSI's acceptance guideline, that filter response maps may differ by at most 1% at any voxel from the reference response map, is applied.
